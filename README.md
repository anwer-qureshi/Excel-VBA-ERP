## Excel ERP — Excel-Based ERP System in VBA

* **Excel ERP** is a modular enterprise resource planning framework developed entirely in **Microsoft Excel VBA**. It is designed for small and medium-sized businesses to manage financial, operational, and inventory processes through structured worksheets, standardized tables, and automated posting logic.

## Key Features
* **Modular Architecture** – Independent VBA modules for posting, inventory management, system accounts, and data helpers.
* **Automated Double-Entry Posting** – Fully integrated transaction posting from source documents to ledger accounts.
* **Table-Driven Design** – All data stored in structured Excel ListObjects (tables) for integrity and scalability.
* **Error Logging and Audit Trail** – Centralized posting error tracking with diagnostic data.
* **No Manual Sheet Entry Policy** – Controlled data manipulation via forms and procedures only.

## Technical Highlights
* Written in **VBA**, compatible with **Excel 2019+ / Microsoft 365**.
* Utilizes late-bound scripting dictionaries for flexible data handling.
* Implements consistent naming conventions and helper utilities for maintainability.
* Supports staged processing for **Sales Invoices**, **General Ledger**, and **Inventory Transactions**.
